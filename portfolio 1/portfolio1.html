      <p class = "mb-5 text-white container text-center my-auto">Confined to our homes with social and physical distancing 
        being the new norm, it is to no
        surprise that feelings of loneliness and isolation are felt more strongly than ever. Working with
        my partner Ivan Lee, our project aims to showcase the duality of living alone and living at home
        during the 2020 pandemic by comparing and contrasting the more social aspects of living with
        family, to the more isolating feeling of being confined alone.</p>

                  <p>My main contributions to the pre-production process included creating a visual effect and
                  storyboarding. Having done a viusal effects activity in week 6 of the course, I was able to learn the
                  new skill of creating split screens through the software program Premiere Pro. Knowing that my partner 
                  and I intended to include this effect in our film, gaining the ability to create the split screen effect
                  was useful in helping us envision our concept more clearly. 

                  In addition to creating visual effects, I also drew out storyboards of envisioned shots. 
                  By clarifying specific details, such as field of view, camera angles, and camera movements
                  of each shot, I created a guide that helped my partner and I understand the direction of our film.
                  <br>
                  Besides technical skills, I also participated in weekly meetings to
                  discuss and refine the vision of the story with my partner. </p>

                  <p align = "center">The visual effects I explored during this project were the split screen effect and the walk-by transition.
                    Since split screens can be used to depict multiple shots simultaneously, this effect fit perfectly
                    with the projects goal of emphasizing the juxtaposition of living at home and living alone.
                    Additionally, the walk-by transition created a fun and unique element that enhanced the 
                    playful tone of our video. Watch the video below to see the effects! </p>

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      To achieve the split screen effect on Premiere Pro, I applied a crop function to the
                      selected footages. Once applied, keyframes were used to mark the
                      positions, the left crop, and the right crop, of the footages at both the initial and the end of
                      where the split screen were applied. By adjusting the keynotes and crops of the footage, I was able
                      to create a simple split screen effect.
                      </p>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <p>With split screens allowing side by side shots to be displayed simultaneously, the film is able to
                        visually compare and contrast the similarities and differences of family life and solo life. This, in
                        turn, could enhance viewerâ€™s understandings of the project, as the intentions of depicting
                        duality in our film becomes clearer when shots are physically shown side by side to compare.
                        While split screens are effective in portraying duality, they can also be used to tell the story
                        more efficiently in a given time frame. Showing multiple footages at once allocated more
                        time for the interviews, which were equally important in conveying the message of
                        our story.</p>

                          <br>
                          <br>
                          The walk-by transition was created using inverted masks and a pen tool. Starting
                          from where my partner began to walk across the screen, and continuing on
                          frame by frame, I used a pen tool outlining his figure to create an inverted mask shape.
                          As my partner walked off screen, the mask allowed video footage underneath to be revealed
                          gradually; this created a smooth transition from one shot to the next.
                          Adding the walk-by transition created a fun and unique element to our playful vlog.

                      <p> During the editing process I was also in charge of adjusting sound volume and matching
                          audio clips to interview video footages. This included adjusting the volumes of the interview by
                          unlinking, cutting, and adjusting audio through the audio tab, as well as
                          matching audio by unlinking and re-positioning audio files in realtion
                          to video files. Audio adjustment was an 
                          important step in ensuring our video was cohesive, producing a quality
                          video with quality sound.

                    Though implementation of the project required much collaboration
                    and communication amongst my team member and I, especially given
                    the circumstances of the 2020 pandemic, in the end, the process of
                    creating a film at home provided a new
                    experience that allowed for fun creative thinking.
                    Bound to the comforts of our own home, this project offered the unique
                    challenge of innovating
                    new ways to use regular-everyday objects as creative solutions for filmmaking means.
                    From this experience I learned to overcome new challenges, developing and strenghtening my own abilities
